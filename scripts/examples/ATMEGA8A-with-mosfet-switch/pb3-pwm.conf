# File to load a content of flash memory from.
firmware_file pb3-pwm.hex

# Reset flash memory flag.
#
# Flash memory of the microcontrollers can be preserved between the different
# simulations by default. Memory preserving means that the flash memory can be
# saved in a separate utility file before the end of a simulation and
# loaded back during the next one.
#
# Default value (no) means that the utility file has a priority over the one
# provided by the 'firmware_file' option.
reset_flash yes

# Firmware test flag. Simulation can be started in a firmware test mode in
# which simulator will not be waiting for any external event (like a command
# from debugger) to continue with the simulation.

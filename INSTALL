How to install MCUSim
---------------------

 This file contains an instruction about installing MCUSim from sources.

Prerequisites
-------------

 MCUSim is written in C99 on FreeBSD and macOS operating systems, and thus a
 complete C compilation environment is needed. CMake build system is required
 to generate build files for various operating systems including GNU/Linux
 and Windows.

 If you want to enable additional features (Lua-based models, XSPICE library,
 etc.) the following software should be installed: lua (5.2 or above),
 GNU make, readline, bison, flex, X11 headers and libs.

 If you want to contribute to the project you will need the following
 software installed: astyle, python (2.7 or above), cppcheck (1.83 or above),
 avr-libc (optional, to compile AVR tests firmware), srecord (optional,
 to compile AVR tests firmware).

Install from tarball (e.g. mcusim-0.2.0.tar.gz)
------------------------------------------------

 This part covers installation from a release distribution (for example
 mcusim-0.2.0.tar.gz). You may download tarball with the latest release
 version from http://mcusim.org.

 After downloading the tarball to a local directory unpack it using:

        $ tar -xvf mcusim-0.2.0.tar.gz

 Now change directory in to the top-level source directory (where this
 INSTALL file can be found) and type:

        $ mkdir build-release
        $ cd build-release
        $ cmake -DWITH_LUA=True -DWITH_POSIX_PTY=True -DWITH_POSIX_THREADS=True ..
        $ make

 There are optional steps to run tests and install a library of the simulator
 (libmsim), headers, default configuration file (mcusim.conf) and executable
 binary (mcusim):

	$ make tests
        $ sudo make install

 The default install directory for executables is /usr/local/bin. These steps
 will be enough to compile a basic version of MCUSim. See the section titled
 'Advanced install' for instructions about additional arguments that can be
 passed to cmake to customize the build and installation.

 Useful MCUSim version can be compiled with the prefered cmake arguments:
 -DWITH_LUA=True -DWITH_POSIX_PTY=True -DWITH_POSIX_THREADS=True
 -DWITH_XSPICE=True
 (see 'Advanced install' section for details).

 FreeBSD users may have to add "-I/usr/local/include" to the CFLAGS
 environment variable and "-L/usr/local/lib" to the LDFLAGS environment
 variable to let MCUSim find GNU readline headers and libraries if
 -DWITH_XSPICE option has been enabled.

Install from the git repository
-------------------------------

 This part covers installation from sources taken directly from the git
 repository. You may wish to follow this way if you want to use the most
 recent version of MCUSim with the latest features or contribute to the
 repository.

 Clone repository using:

        $ git clone git@github.com:dsalychev/mcusim.git

 And follow the steps after tarball unpacking described above, in the
 'Install from tarball' section. There are options which can be passed to
 cmake during configuration step. You may read 'Advanced install'
 section to find these options described and additional instructions.

 If you want to code any feature and share a patch, please install pre-commit
 hooks from the repository root:

        $ ./scripts/install-hooks.sh

 They will check any changes in a commit to follow code format of the project
 and report violations on a per-file basis with the exact lines to adjust.

Advanced install
----------------

 These options can be provided to CMake during 'cmake ..' configuration step:

 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
        Build a release version of MCUSim. This is a default option.
        Executables will not have debug symbols included. Debug output will
        be disabled.

 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
        Build a debug version of MCUSim. Executables will have debug symbols
        included.

 -DWITH_LUA=True
        Build MCUSim with Lua-based models support. Configuration will not be
        finished successfully if Lua is not installed.

 -DWITH_XSPICE=True
        Build MCUSim with XSPICE code model (i.e. mcusim.cm) library.
        It is a shared object linked statically with MCUSim which contains
        NGSpice models of the supported microcontrollers.
        Please, note that NGSpice tarball with source code will be downloaded,
        patched and compiled to provide the library (see -DNGSPICE_TARBALL and
        -DNGSPICE_TARBALL_MD5 options also).

 -DNGSPICE_MAKE=/usr/bin/make
        Build NGSpice using specified make utility. It should be GNU make.

 -DNGSPICE_TARBALL=/home/dsl/ngspice-28.tar.gz
        Full path to the NGSpice tarball. This option is useful if you are not
        going to download tarball from the Web.

 -DNGSPICE_TARBALL_MD5=a11c1f99753934be7d60c0ab43821bbc
        MD5 hash of the NGSpice tarball provided via -DNGSPICE_TARBALL option.

 -DWITH_FPIC=False
        Build MCUSim library with a position-independent code (-fPIC) option.
        This one is true by default and can be deactivated by providing a
        false value.

 -DWITH_POSIX_PTY=True
        Build MCUSim with POSIX pseudo-terminals support. Configuration
        will not be finished successfully if POSIX pseudo-terminals are not
        supported by the host operating system. False value forces MCUSim to
        not support pseudo-terminals even if they are available.

 -DWITH_POSIX_THREADS=True
        Build MCUSim with POSIX threads. Configuration will not be finished
        successfully if the POSIX threads are not supported by the host
        operating system.
